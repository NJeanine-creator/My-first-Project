  So far in my study at Moringa School, I have learned more in programming languages. In Moringa School, I am student
  of Wecode Rwanda program. As the key of objectives of program, We learn how to code that is why We learned different
  languages used in coding as well as in programming.
  <strong><em> Below I am going to share some of projects I have complished so far</em></strong>

          I've learnt quite a lot with HTML and CSS before completing this project.
          Then it was my time to build a website of my choice with the concepts that I have learnt.
          My project was about the websits that teach the people how to dance.

          Within this project we have completed four games with different task to complete.
          This was bassed to Africa heritage or culture in general. I have used the language I have learned
          to complete those tasks. Those language was hyper text markup language used to build a website
          and cascanding style sheet used for styling my website.

          Through my programming journey, I have learned new language that called<strong>Javascript</strong>
          JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
          It is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages. So I have used the javascipt to complete a hangman games
          also called chance games.
