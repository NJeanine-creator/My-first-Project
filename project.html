<strong>YOU MIGHT NOT THINK THAT PROGRAMMERS ARE ARTISTS, BUT PROGRAMMING IS AN EXTREMELY CREATIVE PROFESSION.IT'S LOGIC-BASED CREATIVITY." John ROMERO.</strong><br>
<br>
Hello world! Welcome to my digital portfolio. My name is Jeanine NISHIMWE.I am young lady with 20 years of old.
<br>
<br>
I am currently student at Moringa School in Wecode Rwanda Program, and I want to be a good professional programmer as my future career. I am really interested in becoming an IT women in the field of Networking Company where I can continue to grow and improve myself both personally and professionally.
This websites depicts all of the work that I have completed through this program in Honors English. It displays the growth and the progress that I have made, as well as the assignments I am most proud of. Over the past four months, I have put time, energy, and effort into my tasks and have learned more than ever because of it. Reflecting on my work has shown me how far I have come as both a student, and a person.</p>
